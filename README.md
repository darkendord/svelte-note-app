*Stick note web app*

# svelte app

This is a project template created with Svelte framework and is the result of a Svelte course I took.
Here I show my skills and how I implement functionalities on a web app.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then s:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.


If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) I recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code] If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```
